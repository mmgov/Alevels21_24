    The specific attainment measure used is TALLPPE_ALEV_1618, which is the average point score per A level entry, which I understand to be a score
      which represents the attainment for each person/pupil who sat A level examinations that academic year. The analysis presented here uses the mean (or average) TALLPPE_ALEV_1618 for
        each indvidual school/college, which is then grouped up and averaged for each of the different school types. 
        In other words, the DfE publishes the mean TALLPPE_ALEV_1618 of all the pupils attending a particular school. I then have taken that average
        and grouped up all the individual mean school scores by their category/type and made a new average based on that school type. The end result is actually an average of an average.
